Rush00

Version 0

1.  File compiles as wanted
2.  File executes as wanted
3.  Norminette puts out 4 errors
    a.  rush03.c        Missing 42 header
    b.  rush03.c        Function has more than 25 lines
    c.  ft_putchar.c    Missing 42 header
    d.  main.c          Missing 42 header

    a, c, d             easy fix:   copy into VIM -> press F1
    b,                  hard fix:   write more functions inside of rush03.c
